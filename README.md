# CPP_background_process_remover
The CPP background process remover is a simple program i will be making to further practice c++, its a program in which enables me to quickly shut down and remove any applications running in the background that i do not need.

Ideas - Tasks
1) Assign numerals 1 FOR disc... 2 FOR Steam...
2) Be able to view/monitor running proccesses in background
3) Be able to simply enter 1 OR 2 and terminate that process according to what application is assigned to the numeral
